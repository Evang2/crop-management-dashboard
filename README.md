# Crop Management Dashboard


A Smart Agriculture System for Data-Driven Crop Management Using IoT and AI

The Crop Management Dashboard is a web-based platform designed to enhance agricultural productivity and sustainability through real-time environmental monitoring and AI-driven decision support. Developed as part of a BSc (Hons) Computer Science thesis at the University of East London, this project integrates Arduino-based sensors and machine learning to provide farmers with actionable insights for optimizing irrigation, fertilization, and crop selection.

This repository contains the source code for the dashboard, including hardware configurations, backend APIs, machine learning models, and the frontend interface. The system is detailed in the thesis titled "Smart Agriculture: A Data-Driven Decision Support System Using Arduino and AI for Optimized Crop Management" by Andreas Evangeliou.

## Features

- <b> Real-Time Monitoring: </b> Collects data on soil moisture, NPK (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium) levels, temperature, and humidity using Arduino-based sensors.
- <b> AI-Driven Crop Recommendations: </b> Utilizes a deep learning neural network (TensorFlow) to recommend optimal crops based on soil and climate conditions, achieving ~94% accuracy.
- <b> Interactive Dashboard: </b> Visualizes sensor data, historical trends, and crop recommendations through dynamic charts and alerts using React.js.
- <b> Resource Optimization: </b> Provides data-driven suggestions to minimize water and fertilizer waste, promoting sustainable farming practices.
- <b> Scalable Architecture: </b> Modular design supports small- and large-scale farming with potential for additional sensors (e.g., pH, weather).
- <b> Ethical Design: </b> Ensures data privacy, low-energy hardware, and compliance with EU regulations (GDPR, WEEE Directive).
